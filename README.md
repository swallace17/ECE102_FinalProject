# ECE102_Project
This is the source code, report, and presentation of a project for our ECE102 Project. (Included is our implementation of  basic method of parsing an html document and programatically creating an excel document)

There is an enormous amount of data out there on the web, but most of the time it is not held in a format which is able to be easilyimported into tools where that data can actually be put to use. The applications of this data are left to whatever analysis was included by the authors who published the data originally. Attempting further analysis of data available on the web can be tedious and time consuming at best. For our final project, we set about showing a method of parsing data from an online source into a workable format.

***
Full details can be found in report.pdf, but the basis of the project is parsing an html source into a 2D array containing only relevent information and refactoring that array into a barebones excel spreadsheet written in the XML format.
